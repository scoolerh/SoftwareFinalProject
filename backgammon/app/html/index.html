                <h2>How to Play: </h2>
                <h3>Basics</h3>
                <p>Backgammon is a 2-player board game, with each player having 15 pieces of a different color.</p>  
                <!--[sample board picture ?]-->    
                <p>Each player has a home section of the board, and the goal is to move all your pieces to your home board, 
                    and then ‘bear off’ into the end game section.
                </p>
                <h3>Turns</h3>
                <p>To take a turn, you roll two dice. Each die result symbolizes one move. 
                    For example, if you roll a 2 and a 3, you may move one piece two spaces and another three spaces, 
                    or you may move the same piece two and then three spaces. If you roll doubles, the dice also doubles. 
                    Therefore, you have four moves instead of two. So if you roll double 6s, you can move six spaces four times.
                </p>
                <p>Each player moves in the direction of their home. 
                    When you move, you can only move a piece into a space that is empty, contains your pieces, 
                    or has only one of your opponent’s pieces. 
                    You cannot move into a space that has more than one of your opponent’s pieces.
                </p>
                <p>If you can play both dice, you must. If you can only move one die, you must. 
                    If you can play either die, but only one, you must choose the larger one. 
                    If you cannot play, you forfeit your turn.
                </p>      
                <h3>Capturing</h3>
                <p>If you land on a space containing one opponent’s piece, you capture that piece, and it moves into the center. 
                    If it is your turn and any of your pieces are captured, you must free them before making any other move.
                </p>
                <p>To free a captured piece, you move it into the opponent’s home. 
                    Each slot in their home corresponds with a die roll,
                    and you can move your piece into the slots corresponding to your die roll if those slots are open. 
                    So, if you roll a 1, you can move your piece into the outermost slot in your opponent’s home, 
                    as long as it is an available space. If your opponent is blocking both spaces indicated by your roll, 
                    you cannot move and forfeit your turn. If you freed all your piece(s) but did not use your entire dice roll, 
                    you may use the remaining amount to move any piece(s).
                </p>    
                <h3>Bearing Off</h3>
                <p>Once you have all of your pieces in your home section, you can begin to ‘bear off.’ 
                    This means moving your pieces off the board to the end game section, where they leave game play. 
                    If you get captured during this process, 
                    you must free your pieces and wait until all of your pieces are again in your home to continue bearing off. 
                    When bearing off, the dice roll corresponds to the slots in your home section, 
                    similar to when freeing a captured piece. So, if you roll a 6 you may bear off a piece in the sixth slot. 
                    If that slot is empty, you may bear off a piece in the next highest-numbered slot. 
                    If you roll a 1 and a 2, you may choose to bear off pieces from the first and second slot, 
                    or you may move further away pieces closer. For example, you could move a piece in the sixth slot to the third slot.
                </p>
                <h3>Winning</h3>
                <p>The first player to bear off all of their pieces wins.
