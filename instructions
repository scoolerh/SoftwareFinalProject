Wait for "successfully connected to database" before using the app
If you love to cheat, this is the site for you! If you want to fabricate your own moves or give yourself more wins, 
    you can try to figure out how to manipulate the html. We would love it if you didn't do that though, to be considerate towards your competitors.
If you want to play another player: we do not accept sloppy login. If you fail to successfully log in, you are just assigned as a guest. Keep track of your usernames and passwords, it is an important lesson.
